# DoDates
## A simple app to help students schedule when to do homework assignments
### App
Students will be able to view a calendar with when their assignments are due (the due dates) *and* when they plan to do them (the do dates). There will be a filter option so they can just view the due dates or just view the do dates. Functionality will include the ability to add classes, add assignments with their due dates, and set do dates of when the student will actually do the assignment.

## Business
We call our customers "students" since the majority of them are students in classes (although it is possible for a customer to be someone else using the app as a to-do list).

So far, no students have worked on it, since it is still just an idea. A development team of 3-4 people would suffice.

If time, or in the future, we will have an option to link this app to a student's school website to pull classes and assignments directly into the app (e.g. connecting to Canvas, LearningSuite, etc.) so students won't have to enter each assignment by hand.

Since the target audience is college students and college students are almost always struggling financially, there will be no attempt to monetize DoDates.

## Legal
DoDates will include a privacy policy, but has no end-user license agreement (EULA) nor service level agreement (SLA).

## Technical
DoDates code will be available in a [github repository](https://github.com/byucs452s2019/DoDates).

The technology that will be used is yet to be decided and is negotiable, but the NoSQL database we are leaning towards is some type of document database.
